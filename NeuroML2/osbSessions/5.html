    <p><strong>What are the properties of the ion channels?</strong></p>
    
    <p>Now let's focus on an ion channel. <strong style="color:#ff5a02">K_Pst</strong> is a slowly inactivating (effectively persistent) K conductance.</p>
    
    <p>To investigate the properties of the channel, graphs of the voltage dependence of the opening and closing of the gates can be 
        created under <strong>Plot activation variables</strong></p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Click on 
        <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Gate: m, steady state (inf<sub>m</sub>)</strong> and <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Gate: h, steady state (inf<sub>h</sub>)</strong>.
        These show the steady state of the activation (m, increased probability for gate being open with higher v) and inactivation (h, decreases with higher v) variables.</p>
    
    <p><i>Note: you can hide the legend for the traces which appears on the main graph frame by pressing <i class="fa fa-list" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#ff5a02"></i>
        on the top of the graph window.</i></p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Click on 
        <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Gate: m, time course (tau<sub>m</sub>)</strong> and <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Gate: h, time course (tau<sub>h</sub>)</strong>
        to show how quickly the gates open/close at different voltages. While the m gate has a maximum time course of approx 50ms, the inactivation is much slower, 
        peaking at about 1.2 seconds, which means the channel will not normally have a chance to inactivate during normal spiking.</p>
