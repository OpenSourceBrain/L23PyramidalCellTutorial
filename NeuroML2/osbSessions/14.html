    <p><strong>Persisting the model</strong></p>
    
    <p>On the top bar you can find the <strong>Persist</strong> button, in the shape of a star (<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#ff5a02"></i>). 
        With it you can add this model (and all its experiments) to your model collection for easy access.</p> 
    
    <p>The button will be disabled if the model has already been persisted, or you're not logged in.</p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Press the Persist button now to save this model.</p>
    
    <p>All persisted models will appear on your homepage when logged in so you can access them again.</p>
