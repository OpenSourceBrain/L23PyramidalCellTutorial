    <p><strong>Persisting the model</strong></p>
    
    <p>On the top bar you can find the <strong>Persist</strong> button, in the shape of a star (<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#ff5a02"></i>). 
        With it you can add this model (and all its experiments) to your model collection for easy access.</p> 
    
    <p>The button will be disabled if the model has already been persisted, or you're not logged in. 
        All persisted models will appear on your homepage when logged in so you can access them again.</p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Press the Persist button now to save this model.</p>
