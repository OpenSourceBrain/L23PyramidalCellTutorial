    <p><strong>What are the properties of the model?</strong></p>
    
    <p>OSB can extract all of the physiological properties of the model from the NeuroML files and present 
        them in a more accessible form through this interface.</p>
    
    <p>The <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Model Description</strong> "widget" 
        should have opened on the left, but if not press the button on the top left.</p>
    
    <p>This contains an outline of the properties of the model, including:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Populations</strong><br/>Which populations of cells are present (in this case, a single population with just one pyramidal cell)</p>
    <p><strong>Cells</strong><br/>The different types of cells in the current network</p>
    <p><strong>Ion Channels</strong><br/>The ion channels underlying the active conductances of the model cell</p>
    <p><strong>Inputs</strong><br/>The electrical stimulations which will be applied to the cell, in this case current clamp pulses</p>
