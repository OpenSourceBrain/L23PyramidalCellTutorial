    <p><strong>Simulating the electrical activity of the cell</strong></p>
    
    <p>The <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Experiments</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen lists the completed simulations, or "experiments".</p>
    
    <p>Listed here are 2 completed experiments:</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;> Depolarizing current pulse</strong><br/>
        A 3.5 second simulation during which a 2 second depolarizing current clamp input (180pA) was applied</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;> Hyperpolarizing current pulse</strong><br/>
        Similar to above, but with a hyperpolarizing current clamp input (-100pA)</p>
    
    <p>In both cases a small hyperpolarising current (-70pA) was applied for the full simulation duration to keep the membrane potential at ~-83mV.</p>
