    <p><strong>Simulating the electrical activity of the cell</strong></p>
    
    
    <p>The usual steps for running simulations are:</p>
    
    <p>1) The user <strong>views the NeuroML model</strong> through their browser, potentially changing some parameter values</p>
    
    <p>2) The model, changed parameter values and a description of what variables to record/how long to run the simulation for are <strong>sent to the OSB server</strong></p>
    
    <p>3) The OSB server will <strong>generate simulator code</strong> (usually for the <a href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/" target="_blank">NEURON simulator</a>)
        and execute this, saving the results</p>
    
    <p>4) The <strong>completed simulations</strong> show up in the Experiments tab at the bottom of the screen</p>
    
    <p>Users need to be logged in to run their own simulations, but we have pre-recorded a few for you to look at...</p>
