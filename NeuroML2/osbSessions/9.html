    <p><strong>Simulating the electrical activity of the cell</strong></p>
    
    <p>This plot shows traces recoded in the <strong>Depolarizing current pulse</strong> experiment (the data may take a few seconds to load).</p>
    
    <p><i><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Resizing the window will make the traces easier to see.</i></p>
    
    <p>There are four traces showing membrane potential at:<br/>
        &nbsp;> the soma<br/>
        &nbsp;> the end of the axon<br/>
        &nbsp;> half way along the main apical dendrite<br/>
        &nbsp;> a point on the apical tuft furthest from the soma</p>
    
    <p><i>Note: a plot like this showing all the traces recorded for the current experiment can quickly be created by selecting 
            <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Results</strong> -> <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Plot all recorded variables</strong> in the 
            menu at the top of the screen.
