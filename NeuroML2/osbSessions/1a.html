    <p><strong>How is this visualized on OSB?</strong></p>
    
    <p>The original BBP cell model (as well as their full neocortical microcircuit model) was developed to run 
        in the <a href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/" target="_blank">NEURON simulator</a>.</p>
    
    <p>To allow the model to be used on Open Source Brain, it was converted to simulator independent <a href="https://neuroml.org" target="_blank">NeuroML format</a> 
        (see technical details <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/tree/master/NMC/NeuroML2" target="_blank">here</a>), and 
        that is what is being visualised in this interface.</p> 
    
    <p>To see the original XML code which generated this model click <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/L23PyramidalCellTutorial/blob/master/NeuroML2/L23_cADpyr.cell.nml" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
        
    <p>However, one of the advantages of the model being in NeuroML and shared on OSB is that you don't need to look at the original source code to see the model structure and properties...</p>
