    <p><strong>What am I looking at?</strong></p>
    
    <p>To allow the model to be used on Open Source Brain, it was converted to simulator independent <a href="https://neuroml.org" target="_blank">NeuroML format</a> 
        (see technical details <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/tree/master/NMC/NeuroML2" target="_blank">here</a>), and 
        that is what is being visualised in this interface.</p> 
    
    <p>To see the original XML code which generated this model click <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/L23PyramidalCellTutorial/blob/master/NeuroML2/L23_cADpyr.cell.nml" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
        
    <p>However, one of the advantages of the model being in NeuroML and shared on OSB is that you don't need to look at the original source code to see the model properties...</p>
