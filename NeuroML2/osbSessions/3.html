    <p><strong>What are the properties of the cell?</strong></p>
    
    <p>Now let's focus on the cell model. The cell is named <strong style="color:#ff5a02">L23_cADpyr</strong>
        (Layer 2/3 continuous accommodating pyramidal cell).</p>
    
    <p>Selecting this in the <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Model Description</strong> widget displays the properties of the cell. 
        There are <strong>1148 segments</strong> (based on the 3D points/radii from the neuronal reconstruction) and 
        <strong>132 segment groups</strong> consisting of sections of neurites between branch points as well as larger segment groups such as basal dendrites, axon, etc.</p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Click on 
        <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Highlight cell regions</strong> in the widget (link is under
        <strong>Click to apply colouring to the cell morphology</strong>). The cell should change color indicating the different regions:</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;> <strong style="color:#0066FF">soma</strong> - consisting of a set of flat segments recreating the shape of the pyramidal cell soma</strong><br/>
    &nbsp;> <strong style="color:#99CC00">dendrites</strong> - the basal and apical dendrites</strong><br/>
    &nbsp;> <strong style="color:#FF6600">axon</strong> - the short axon which has been added to the model in place of the reconstructed axon. </p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> You may need to rotate/zoom in on the cell to see the axon 
        (use the mouse or the <i class="fa fa-search-plus" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#ff5a02"></i>, <i class="fa fa-repeat" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#ff5a02"></i>, etc. buttons on the left).</strong></p>
