    <p><strong>What are the properties of the cell?</strong></p>
    
    <p>Now let's focus on the cell model. The cell is named <strong><span style="color:#ff5a02">L23_cADpyr</span> </strong>
        (Layer 2/3 continuous accommodating pyramidal cell).</p>
    
    <p>Selecting this in the <strong> <span style="color:#ff5a02">Model Description</span></strong> widget displays the properties of the cell. 
        There are <strong>1148 segments</strong> (based on the 3D points/radii from the neuronal reconstruction) and 
        <strong>132 segment groups</strong> consisting of sections of neurites between branch points as well as larger segment groups such as basal dendrites, axon, etc.</p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Click on 
        <strong> <span style="color:#ff5a02">Highlight cell regions</span></strong> in the widget (link is under
        <strong>Click to apply colouring to the cell morphology</strong>). The cell should change color indicating the different regions:</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#0066FF">soma</span></strong> - consisting of a set of flat segments recreating the shape of the pyramidal cell soma</strong><br/>
    &nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#99CC00">dendrites</span></strong> - the basal and apical dendrites</strong><br/>
    &nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#FF6600">axon</span></strong> - the short axon which has been added to the model in place of the reconstructed axon. 
    The cell may need to be rotated to see this.</strong></p>
