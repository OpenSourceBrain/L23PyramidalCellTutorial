    <p><strong>What are the active conductances on the cell?</strong></p>
    
    <p>There are a number of active conductances placed on the different regions of the cell which underlie its electrical activity. 
        These are listed in the table at the bottom of the widget and the colors indicate the types of ion which flows through the channels causing the conductance:</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#1E90FF">Sodium - Na<sup>+</sup></span></strong>  <br/>
       &nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#cd5c5c">Potassium - K<sup>+</sup></span></strong> <br/>
       &nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#8FBC8F">Calcium - Ca<sup>2+</sup></span></strong> <br/>
       &nbsp;> <strong><span style="color:#A9A9A9">Non specific </span></strong> </p>

    <p>The colored scales indicate the relative densities of the different conductances on the cell using a logarithmic scale. 
        The <strong style="color:#FF0000">red dot</strong> (and the value printed on the right) shows the highest density present, 
        and (if the conductance is not uniform across the cell) the <strong style="color:#FFFF00">yellow dot</strong> shows the lowest (non-zero) density.</p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Click on <strong style="color:#ff5a02">NaTs2_t</strong>
        (on the left of the blue rows in the table). This highlights the distribution of this transient Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, with a large concentration on the soma, 
        a lower density on the apical dendrites, and zero conductance (shows as white on the cell) on the basal dendrites and axon.</p>
    
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> The highest densities present are for 
        <strong style="color:#ff5a02">NaTa_t</strong> and <strong style="color:#ff5a02">K_Pst</strong>. Click on each of these in turn to show that these 
            channels are only present on the axon (and result in this being the location of action potential initiation).</strong>
            
    <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Click on <strong style="color:#ff5a02">Ih_apical</strong>
            to show how the conductance underlying the I<sub>h</sub> current varies on the apical dendrite from low for proximal locations to high at the apical tuft.</p>
