    <p><strong>What am I looking at?</strong></p>
    
    <p>This is a model of a Layer 2/3 pyramidal cell which was originally developed in the 
        <a href="https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">Blue Brain Project</a>.</p>
    
    <p>It uses a reconstruction of a L2/3 pyramidal cell neuronal morphology from the Markram lab 
        for its 3D structure, with a set of active membrane conductances from 
        <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002107" target="_blank">Hay et al. 2011</a></p>
    
        
    <p>The parameters of the model were tuned to match electrophysiological recordings from an identified L2/3 
        (<a href="https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/glossary">continuous, accommodating</a>) pyramidal cell.</p>
    
    <p>More details on the original model can be found on the <a href="https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit" target="_blank">BBP Neocortical Microcircuit portal</a> website.</p>
