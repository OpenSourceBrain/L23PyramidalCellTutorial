    <p><strong>What am I looking at?</strong></p>
    
    <p>This is a model of a Layer 2/3 pyramidal cell which was originally developed in the <a href=https://bbp.epfl.ch">Blue Brain Project</a>.</p>
    
    <p>It uses a reconstruction of a L2/3 neuronal morphology from the Markram lab for its 3D structure, and the parameters of the model are tuned to match electrophysical recordings also obtained by the lab.</p>
    
    <p>More details on the original model can be found on the <a href=https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit">BBP Neocortical Microcircuit portal</a> website.</p>
