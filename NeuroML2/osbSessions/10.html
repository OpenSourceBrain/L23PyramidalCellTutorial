    <p><strong>Analysing the spiking activity of the cell</strong></p>
    
    <p>A number of things can be seen from these traces:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Not all parts of the cell have the same resting membrane potential</strong> <br/>
        This is due to the different complement of ion channels in different parts of the cell
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>The action potential initiates in the axon</strong> <br/>
        <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd0000"></i> Zoom in on the first spike (left click on the plot and select the area around the spike), 
        as shown below. The orange trace for the axon clearly peaks before the red of the soma.

    <p><strong>The action potential at the axon is narrow</strong> <br/>
        The high concentration of fast Na<sup>+</sup> channels (leading to strong depolarization) and rapidly activating K<sup>+</sup> channels 
        (quickly repolarizing the axon towards the reversal potential for K<sup>+</sup>, -85mV), causes a narrow AP at the axon.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>The action potential backpropagates into the dendrite</strong> <br/>
        It is however quite attenuated when it reaches the apical dendrite tip.
