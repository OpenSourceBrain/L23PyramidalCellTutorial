    <p><strong>Analysing the spiking activity of the cell</strong></p>
    
    <p>A number of things can be seen from these traces:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Not all parts of the cell have the same resting membrane potential</strong> <br/>
        This is due to the different complement of ion channels in different parts of the cell
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>The action potential initiates in the axon</strong> <br/>
        This can be seen by zooming in on the first spike, as shown below. The orange trace for the axon clearly peaks before the red of the soma.

    <p><strong>The action potential backpropagates into the dendrite</strong> <br/>
        It is however quite attenuated when it reaches the apical dendrite tip.
